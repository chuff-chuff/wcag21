         <h2>達成方法に関する重要な情報</h2>
         <p>See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/understanding-techniques">Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria</a> for important information about the usage of these informative techniques and how
            they relate to the normative WCAG 2.1 success criteria. The Applicability section
            explains the scope of the technique, and the presence of techniques for a specific
            technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all situations to create
            content that meets WCAG 2.1.

            <h2>適用 (対象)</h2>
            <p>Applies to all technologies</p>
            <p>This technique relates to <span><a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/understanding/non-text-content">Success Criterion 1.1.1: Non-text Content</a> (Sufficient)</span>.

            <h2>解説</h2>
            <p>The objective of this technique is to provide a way to link to remote long
               descriptions in technologies that do not have a long description feature
               built directly into them (e.g., longdesc) or where the feature is known to
               not be supported.
            </p>
            <p>With this technique, the long description is provided in another location
               than the non-text content. This could be at another location within the same
               URI or at another URI. A link to that long description is provided that is
               immediately adjacent to the non-text content. The link can be immediately
               before or after the non-text content. If the description is located along
               with other text then put "End of description" at the end so that they know
               when to stop reading and return to the main content. If a "Back" button will
               not take the person back to the point from which they jumped, then a link
               back to the non-text content location is provided.
            </p>
            <p>This technique was commonly used in HTML before 'longdesc' was added to the
               specification. In HTML it was called a D-Link because it was usually
               implemented by putting a D next to images and using the D as a link to the
               long description. This technique is not technology specific and can be used
               in any technology that supports links.

               <h3>事例 1: Bar chart</h3>
               <p>There is a bar chart on a Web page showing the sales for the top

                  long description. The alternate text for the image is "Long
                  description of chart". The image links to the bottom of the page
                  where there is a section titled "Description of charts on this
                  page". The link points to this specific description: "Sales for
